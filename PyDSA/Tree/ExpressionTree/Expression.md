## Expression Trees 

An **expression tree* is a binary tree in which the operators are stored in the interior nodes and the operands (the variables or constant values) are stored in the leaves.

Expression tree can be used to evaluate the expression or for converting an infix expression to either prefix or postfix expression.

### Expression Tree ADT 

An *expression tree* is a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression that consists of various operators (+, -, *, /, %) and operands compromised of single integer digits and single-letter variables with a fully parenthesized expression.
