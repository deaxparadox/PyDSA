## Graph Data Structure 


A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also reffered to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 

More formally a graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) 

#### Components of a Graph

1. Vertices
2. Edges

Graphs are used to solve many-real problems. Graph are used to represent networks such as telephones network or circuit. 


#### Types of graph

1. Null Graph
    - A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in the graph.
2. Trivial Graph
    - Graph having only a single vertex. it is also smalled graph possible.
3. Undirected Graph
    - A Graph is which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
4. Directed Graph
    - A graph is which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
5. Connected Graph
    - The graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph.
6. Disconnected Graph
    - The graph in which at least one node is not reachable from ta node is known as a disconnected graph.
